      <h3>Examine possible factors which might have led to changes in 
      the value of the pound sterling against the euro in recent years.<h3>
      <h5>June 2004</h5>
        
        <div class="p1">
      <p>Both the pound and euro are classified as currencies with a floating
      exchange rate. This means their value is determined by market forces of 
      demand and supply.</p>
          
          <div class="p2">
      <p>Due to their highly speculative nature, their value can change very 
      quickly with the slightest news. Uncertainty especially will cause a selling
      of the currency. This is because of the uncertainty investors have about the
      currency’s future, and therefore decide to sell their reserves of it and move
      it to a more certain market. Take for example Brexit, on July 23rd 2016. The 
      referendum’s outcome came to 51% leave, and hence, Brexit was to go ahead. On
      the morning of the 24th, the Pound lost 6% against the Euro within the first 
      few hours of trading. The loss of certainty caused a large decrease in demand
      as well as a large increase in supply. As seen on the Demand and Supply graph 
      below, there was a shift left demand and right of supply. Hence the new price 
      equilibrium sets at Eur2 per Gbp.</p>
